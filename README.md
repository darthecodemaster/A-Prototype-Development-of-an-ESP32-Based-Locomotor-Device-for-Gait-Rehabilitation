This study describes a low-cost and easy to deploy gait rehabilitation system that uses an ESP32 microcontroller with an integration of a  smartphone-accessible graphical user interface (GUI). Thus, utilizing seamless wireless communication via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi protocols inherent to the ESP32 module. A gait rehabilitation device in Arduino platform is presented to provide cost-effective, portable, and user-centric prototype for locomotor-training and related fields testing. This prototype successfully simulated a complete gait cycle with servo-driven joint motion and real-time visualization through an interactive GUI which confirms the feasibility of a low-cost ESP32/Arduino-based gait rehabilitation prototype. This project is intended as a proof-of-concept and feasibility testing device rather than a clinical-grade system.
