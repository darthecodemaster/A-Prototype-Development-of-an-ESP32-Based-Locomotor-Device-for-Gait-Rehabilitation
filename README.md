# A-Prototype-Development-of-an-ESP32-Based-Locomotor-Device-for-Gait-Rehabilitation
This study describes a low-cost and easy to deploy gait rehabilitation system that uses an ESP32 microcontroller with an integration of a  smartphone-accessible graphical user interface (GUI). Thus, utilizing seamless wireless communication via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi protocols inherent to the ESP32 module.
